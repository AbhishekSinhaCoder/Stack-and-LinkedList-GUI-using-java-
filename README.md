# Stack-and-LinkedList-GUI-using-javaFX
***
- Code the push and pop methods to insert onto and delete from a stack represented by an array of ints.
- The framework will animate your code to give you feedback on the correctness of your code. It will display the state of the stack at all times. The result of your operation will be displayed, reflecting the value returned by your push and pop method. The items in the stack will be displayed in black while the array elements that are not part of the stack will be displayed in red.
- Copy the source files provided to a folder on your computer. Load the StackArray.java source file and search for five asterisks in a row (*****). This will position you to the code section where you will add code.
- To test the code, compile StackArray.java and run the StackPracticeApplication class, which contains the main method. When the program begins, a window will display the state of the stack, along with two buttons labelled “push” and “pop”, as shown in the Figure below. Enter a value into the text box, then click on the “push” button to insert onto the stack. Click on the “pop” button to delete from the stack. Close the window to exit the program. If you successively push 34, 56, 12 and 98 onto the stack, then pop once, the window will look like the one below.

For this second programming activity, we will work with a sorted linked list, performing this activity:
- Code the insert and delete methods to insert and delete nodes in a sorted linked list of ints.
- The framework will animate your code to give you feedback on the correctness of your code. It will display the state of the sorted linked list at all times. The result of your operation will be displayed, reflecting the value returned by your push and pop method. The items in the stack will be displayed in black while the array elements that are not part of the stack will be displayed in red.
